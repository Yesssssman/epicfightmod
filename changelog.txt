1.18.x Changelog
40.0
====
 - 40.0.44 Fix issues with custom forge ingredients causing sub ingredients to be prematurely and invalidly cached (#8550)
           Add config option and skip checking for empty ingredients in shapeless recipe deserialization
 - 40.0.43 Add EnderManAngerEvent to make it possible to prevent endermen getting angry at a player based on more then their helmet. (#8406)
 - 40.0.42 Fix misaligned patch in BlockEntity.save.
 - 40.0.41 Expose `getHolder()` method on RegistryObject, as helper for when absolutely necessary to pass  into Vanilla code. (#8548)
           It is recommended you avoid if you can.
 - 40.0.40 Fix return value of Recipe#isIncomplete being inaccurate for empty tags (#8549)
 - 40.0.39 Simplfy default behavior of isSimple (#8543)
           isSimple should only return true if the ingredient is any more sensitive then JUST itemA == itemB
           It used to take metadata and damage into account, but that was removed in the flattening.
           Also prevents fetching tag values too early, as tags are not ready during the ingredient constructor
 - 40.0.38 Implement IPlantable in BambooBlock (#8508)

 - 40.0.26 Add some helper Access Transformers (#8490)
 - 40.0.25 Fix incorrect method used in getStream (#8532)
           The original correct method is getPath, but the patch uses getLocation.
           The former is the actual resource path to the sound OGG file, while the
           latter is the sound's location.
           Fixes #8531
 - 40.0.24 [1.18] Make it easier to register custom skull blocks models (#8351)

 - 40.0.19 Fix NPE caused by canceling onServerChatEvent (#8516)
 - 40.0.18 [1.18.2] Fix tags for custom forge registries. (#8495)
           Tag-enabled registries must now be registered to vanilla's root registry. See RegistryBuilder#hasTags.
           Modded tag-enabled registries have to use the format `data/<namespace>/tags/<registrynamespace>/<registryname>/<tag>.json`
           This format is to prevent conflicts for registries with the same path but different namespaces
           EX: Registry name `examplemod:shoe`, tag name `blue_shoes` would be `data/<namespace>/tags/examplemod/shoe/blue_shoes.json`
           RegistryEvent.NewRegistry has been moved and renamed to NewRegistryEvent.
           RegistryBuilder#create has been made private. See NewRegistryEvent#create
           Created new ITagManager system for looking up Forge tags. See IForgeRegistry#tags.
           Add lookup methods for Holders from forge registries. See IForgeRegistry#getHolder.

 - 40.0.8  Fix durability bar not respecting an item's custom max damage (#8482)
 - 40.0.7  Add event for controlling potion indicators size (#8483)
           This event allows forcing the rendering of the potion indicators in the
           inventory screen to either compact mode (icons only) or classic mode
           (full width with potion effect name).
 - 40.0.6  Introduce system mods to mod loading (#8238)
           Core game mods are mods which are required to exist in the environment
           during mod loading. These may be specially provided mods (for example,
           the `minecraft` mod), or mods which are vital to the framework which
           FML is connected to (for example, Forge and the `forge` mod).
           These core game mods are used as the only existing mods in the mod list
           if mod sorting or dependency verification fails. This allows later
           steps in the which use resources from these mod files to work correctly
           (up to when the error screen is shown and the game exits).
 - 40.0.5  Add missing module exports arg to server arguments list (#8500)
 - 40.0.4  Fixed swim speed attribute (#8499)

 - 39.0.52 Add renderable API to allow easier rendering of OBJ and other custom models, from Entity and BlockEntity renderers. (#8259)
           This is a redesign of a discarded section of my initial model system rewrite, back in 1.14.
           In order to use it with the OBJ loader, you can use OBJLoader.INSTANCE.loadModel to get the OBJModel, and then call OBJModel#bakeRenderable() to get a SimpleRenderable object to render with.
           The SimpleRenderable support animation, by providing different transformation matrices for each part in the MultipartTransforms.
           Additionally, a BakedRenderable helper exists to turn an arbitrary BakedModel into a renderable.
           After trying to get the B3D loader to work, I decided it wasn't worth the trouble and marked it for removal instead.

 - 37.0.121 Deprecate durability bar methods in Item extension (#8214)
            To retain compatibility with existing mods, the vanilla methods redirect
            to the extension methods for now.
            Users should now use and override the vanilla methods as directed in
            the javadocs of the now-deprecated methods, as the extension methods
            will be removed in the future.

            This will also allow other mods which need to calculate small normalised vectors to be able to use the default classes without needing to write their own, while not effecting any side effects created by how the base game uses this function.

            Deprecate helper functions related to ModFile/Metadata.
            Mark ModFileFactory as to be removed from our usage.
            It may be useful for other loaders, but introduces a weird level of indirection that makes things a pain.
            If there are consumers of this API please leave feedback before the next major mc version so we can be sure to provide something useful.
 - 37.0.89  Fix mods with both a manifest and a mods.toml have mismatched module names.
 - 37.0.88  Fix missing toolTip methods in Screen (#8154)
 - 37.0.87  Fix render tooltip render patch (#8153)

 - 37.0.85  Tooltip event rewrite (#8038)
            Redesigns the tooltip events, and adds a feature where mods can register factories for ClientTooltipComponents, which are used for custom rendering in tooltips. The old events are maintained for binary compatibility.
 - 37.0.84  Add ForgeSpawnEggItem to lazily handle EntityTypes (#8044)
 - 37.0.83  Reimplement IForgeBlockEntity#onLoad() hook (#7946)
 - 37.0.82  Implement GUI Stacking feature. (#8130)
            You can now use `mc.pushGuiLayer` and `mc.popGuiLayer` to manage the layers.
            mc.setScreen behaves such that if called with a non-null screen it replaces the entire stack, and if called with null it closes the entire stack.
 - 37.0.81  Add ability for people to add custom pack finders (RepositorySources) (#8121)
            Added AddPackFindersEvent which lets you add additional resource/data pack sources to the game.
            Added PathResourcePack as a utility to allow easy providing of a subfolder in a mod as a resource pack.

            Implements and closes #7996
 - 37.0.77  Fix breaking block particles not respecting IModelData (#8065)
            The sprite used for the block particles needs updating after the constructor otherwise it defaults to the texture sprite returned from passing ModelData.INSTANCE to get IForgeBakedModel#getParticleIcon. Calling updateSprite fetches the real IModelData instance for that blockstate/pos and sets the texture to the desired one
 - 37.0.76  Fix Signs breaking with custom `WoodType`s (#8132)

 - 37.0.71  Prevent call to Item#initializeClient when in datagen (#8097)
            When running under data-generation, the Minecraft singleton is unavailable
            even though the operating env is under the CLIENT dist. Adding this check
            prevents crashes from devs unaware of this, as most uses of
            IItemRenderProperties (usually for a custom BEWLR) make use of the
            Minecraft singleton and therefore will cause NPEs if not guarded against.
            A similar thing happens in MobEffect and Block.
 - 37.0.70  Move ItemStack#forgeInit call earlier to allow earlier capability queries (#8096)
 - 37.0.69  Remove incorrect FallingBlock patch (#8092)
            The patch accidentally replaces the minimum build height (set by the
            dimension via e.g. datapacks) with 0, causing falling blocks placed
            below Y level 0 to never fall.
            Fixes #8091
 - 37.0.68  Fix inverted hooks for PermissionsChangedEvent (#8089)
            Because IEventBus#post returns true on cancellation and the patched-in
            hooks inverts the return of the ForgeHooks method, if the player
            whose permission level is being changed is online and the event is not
            cancelled, the permission change _is_ cancelled.
            The fix is inverting the patched-in hooks and the default return value
            of the ForgeHooks method, so that the permission change is cancelled
            only if the player is online, the event is fired, and the event is cancelled.
            Fixes #8088
 - 37.0.67  Add the missing patch for ItemStack for last build. (#8085)
 - 37.0.66  Support Lazy capabilities on itemstacks, for better ItemStack copy performance. (#7945)

 - 37.0.59  Add mixin full release to install list. (#8076)
 - 37.0.58  Add new tool action for shield blocking, replacing `IForgeItem#isShield` (#8055)
 - 37.0.57  Add workaround for pairs of `'` being stripped (#8050)
            Fixes #7396, where if a translated string with balanced pairs of single
            quote characters passes through ForgeI18n, the quotes are stripped
            because of ExtendedMessageFormat. This is most notable in languages
            where `'` is used frequently, like Canadian French from the bug report.
            Note that unbalanced pairs cause an IllegalArgumentException in
            ExtendedMessageFormat, which means the message is not affected.

 - 37.0.32  Correct incorrect arguments for render hand event (#7987)
 - 37.0.31  Redesign the tool system to rely on the new vanilla tags. (#7970)
            Changed:
            - ToolType is replaced with ToolAction, which can selectively represent which actions are supported by an item.
            - Added a canPerformAction method to query ToolActions.
            - Renamed canHarvestBlock to isCorrectToolForDrops to match vanilla.
            - Added TierSortingRegistry, which can be used to add custom tiers and supports sorting between vanilla or with other mods.
            How to use:
            For the breaking system there's 2 methods:
            - getDestroySpeed decides if an item *can* mine the block fast. Override if you have multiple tags or your item isn't a DiggerItem.
            - isCorrectToolForDrops decides if an item will get drops. Returning false will also slow down mining, regardless of getDestroySpeed. Override if you have type-dependant tiers or your item isn't a DiggerItem.
            For the tier system mods can just call `TierSortingRegistry.registerTier(tier, "name", List.of(lesser tiers), List.of(better tiers));` to register their tiers.
            There's helper methods to query tiers such as TierSortingRegsitry.isCorrectTierForDrops.
            The ToolActions solve 2 problems:
            1. distinguishing which kind of digger an item can be
            2. querying if the item can perform specific secondary actions.
            Any item can override `canPerformAction` to customize which actions it performs.

 - 37.0.16  Re-add call to Ingredient#invalidateAll() (#7953)
 - 37.0.15  Remove Generic from ProjectileImpactEvent (#7959)
            Generification of this event was half-done and has been aborted, leaving the generic parameter in place just creates confusion and crashes

 - 37.0.5   1.17 Fix InitGuiEvent (#7906)
 - 37.0.4   Expose RenderStateShard inner classes (#7895)
            In 1.17, all of the inner classes of `RenderStateShard` (`RenderStateShard.OverlayStateShard`, `RenderStateShard.WriteMaskStateShard`, etc.) have been changed to protected. These classes are needed however to create new `RenderType.CompositeRenderType`'s using `RenderType.CompositeState.CompositeStateBuilder`.
            Since these are protected inner classes, their constructors also can't be directly be obtained using `ObfuscationReflectionHelper`.
            Currently, any mod using custom `RenderType`'s will have to either:
            - add their own access transformer for the inner classes, or
            - extend `RenderStateShard` to access `RenderStateShard`'s inner classes, and extend `RenderType` to access `RenderType.CompositeRenderType`
            This PR changes the visibility of `RenderStateShard`'s inner classes to public in Forge's `accesstransformer.cfg`.
 - 37.0.3   added back attribute patches (#7886)

           rotation and mirroring issues.  I noticed this from problems with
           Structurize, but this probably affects any other mods that allow

           currently active player, the player object within PlayerAdvancement is
           set to the fake player.
           As fake players cannot receive advancements (see grantCriterion), this
           prevents the actual player from receiving any advancements until they

           Closes #7293 (to reproduce issue easily, modify Util.func_240979_a_ and change the values in the MathHelper.clamp call). I've verified that 3 and below for "max" cause the problem. (I didn't test a whole range of values, just sufficient to reproduce problem and verify fix). Note that setting it to zero (and using the "direct executor" that's inaccessible in normal operation) works as well with this fix.
 - 33.0.29 Fix missed debugging code. Read the config from the config.
 - 33.0.28 Fix up slight registry change and other 1.16.2 stuffs.
 - 33.0.27 Merge branch '1.16.1' into 1.16.x

 - 33.0.24 Redo event dispatch, removes a bunch of nonsense, and tries to integrate with the vanilla CF system where possible
 - 33.0.23 Add particle culling (#6981)
 - 33.0.22 Wrap vanilla's 'default' biome registry in ForgeRegistry.
           This should allow registering mod dimensions like in 1.16.1, while the data driven system is fleshed out.
 - 33.0.21 Clarify in the LazyOptional which methods carry the lazyness over to the returned value and which don't. (#6750)
           For consistency, this meant making a few changes:
           - Renamed the existing lazy mapping method to lazyMap, to indicate that it doesn't run the mapping immediately.
           - Added a new implementation of map(), which returns Optional<T>, and resolves the value in the process.
           - Changed filter() to return Optional, since there's no way to filter lazily.
           - Added a new method resolve(), which helps convert the custom LazyOptional class into a standard Optional, for use
           with library methods that expect Optional<T>.
           * Update License headers.

32.0
====
 - 32.0.110 Fix ModelRegistryEvent firing every time resources reload instead of just once.
 - 32.0.109 Move ModelRegistryEvent invocation to when the model loading is about to start.
            Freeze the ModelLoaderRegistry right after this event happens, just before model loading actually begins.
            This means ModelRegistryEvent is now the correct place to register loaders, as it was intended.
            This is a slight breaking change, but any mod that used FMLClientSetupEvent before will need to be updated regardless due to the existing race condition.
 - 32.0.108 Fix wrong BlockState param passed into canSustainPlant from FarmlandBlock (#7212)
 - 32.0.107 Add harvest levels for hoes and new 1.16 blocks for pickaxes Fixes #7187 (#7189)

            This reverts commit 30bad1e2
 - 32.0.97  Revert "Shut down all other mod handlers if the loading cycle errors. This prevents other mods from throwing errors and being blamed for initial cause. This is a temporary hack until cpw re-writes the mod event dispatcher."
            This reverts commit 7592bbe8
 - 32.0.96  Shut down all other mod handlers if the loading cycle errors.
            This prevents other mods from throwing errors and being blamed for initial cause.
            This is a temporary hack until cpw re-writes the mod event dispatcher.
 - 32.0.95  Properly shutdown FMLModContainer's event bus when an error in a lifecycle event is detected.
 - 32.0.94  Enable EventBus type check during ForgeDev, and add IModBusEvent marker to ModelRegistryEvent.
 - 32.0.93  Make license toml entry optional during 1.16.1
            There are to many existing mods to make this required.
            Yes, we are technically before a RB and can do breaking changes. However this is too large.
 - 32.0.92  Missed one event. NewRegistry needs the marker.
 - 32.0.91  Update MDK license to default to All rights reserved, and offer a link to chooseyourlicense.com as a place to research appropriate licenses.
            Note: the license field _is_ backwards compatible and will simply be ignored on older forge versions.
 - 32.0.90  Update coremods and spi, include mandatory license field in metadata. Added at top level of mods.toml file.
 - 32.0.89  Update modlauncher, eventbus, accesstransformers and more to use a newer mechanism for generating ASM.
            Introduced IModBusEvent as a marker interface for events on the ModBus. Expect exceptions if you use
            the modbus for events not listened there.

 - 32.0.75  Remove startupquery. Currently wasn't functional, and 1.16 has out of band state loading in all cases, so the complex functionality there is no longer needed. Going to research using the Lifecycle indicator from DFU as a proxy/replacement. Probably with some codec FUN.
 - 32.0.74  Run Forge's data generators to sync 1.16 vanilla changes.
 - 32.0.73  Don't show the early launcher GUI when running data. It's not needed and prevents use on automated builds.
            Need to investigate why a bunch of tags seem to be being blown away by rerunning on forge.

 - 32.0.45  Update copyright year to 2020.
 - 32.0.44  Model system improvements:
            - Port some things I did in 1.14 which I couldn't do in 1.15 due to breaking changes.
            - Fix multi-layer block models not working (1.16 RenderType doesn't override toString the same way anymore)
            - Implement multi-layer item rendering.
            - Improve CompositeModel submodel data passing.
 - 32.0.43  Pass matrixstack in tooltip render events (#6885)

 - 32.0.35  Add senderUUID to ClientChatReceivedEvent (#6881)
 - 32.0.34  Re-write checkATs function and automate making Items/Blocks public.
 - 32.0.33  Reorganize modloading on the dediserver. This removes the DedicatedServer parameter from the FMLDedicatedServerSetupEvent.
            Code for customizing the server instance should be moved to the ServerAboutToStartEvent or similar, where the server instance
            is available.
            This reorganization means that mods will load fully before the server is even constructed, or the server properties loaded. We also move the EULA right to the front so we don't have to wait for bootstrap.
            This should fix the problems with mods which customize world data and other things.

 - 31.2.15 Fixed --server argument crashing the client (#6754)
           Closes #6753
           Moving the fadeOutStart setter above the callback invocation prevents re-entry into the block (which would result in an infinite loop and a StackOverflowException) if the callback causes a render tick (which creating a new ConnectionScreen does).
 - 31.2.14 Fixed ItemStack comparison ignoring capabilities when stack nbt is null. (#6764)
 - 31.2.13 Supply matrixstack to IRenderHandler where possible. Closes #6439 (#6537)

 - 31.2.10 Add custom registry type support to DeferredRegister. (#6742)
           It's still a hard dependency because it requires a class reference.
           But there is not a sane way to test registry types without a class reference.

           Useful For Forge's test mods mainly.
           Standardized data gen cache file's folder separators.
           Added ItemModelProvider to BlockStateProvider for cleaner datagen code.
           Added .gitattributes to fix datagen json's line endings correct on windows.
 - 31.2.5  Improve the DistExecutor API and introduce some "almost completely" safe mechanisms to handle sided lambdas.
           In general, use sided lambdas safely by embedding them in a separately loaded class. There's a whole twitch stream
           dedicated to investigating this problem. See link in DistExecutor if you're interested.
 - 31.2.4  Fix typo in new registry fields' names
           Note: this is technically a breaking change. If you for some reason added code referencing these two fields in the last few hours, sorry.
 - 31.2.3  Fix server startup query info not including new text
 - 31.2.2  Improve look of notification GUI, improve StartupQuery API
 - 31.2.1  Add forge registries for applicable new registry types

 - 31.1.92 Model system fixes:
           - Add "origin" key to determine what origin to use. This will default to the existing (broken) behaviour to avoid breaking changes.
           - Fix interaction of transforms with variant transforms (transformation ordering).
           - Fix OBJ loader ignoring "diffuseLighting" attribute from the json.
             This attribute will continue not being used if "ambientToFullbright" is on (default) to avoid breaking changes.

           * Pass MatrixStack and IRenderTypeBuffer into the event whenever they are available. If they're available, that means we're in a batching environment and the modder should not be using the tessellator or other buffers on their own, or they risk "Already building" crashes.

 - 28.1.101 Restore camera setup render event (#6335)
 - 28.1.100 Fixed invocation of Vanilla spawn logic (#6334)
            Forge's replacement of the Vanilla logic gets inverted, so the Vanilla logic inside that replacement must be inverted to correct for this.
            (Fixes #6332)
 - 28.1.99  Add item tag 'beacon_payment' for items that can activate a beacon (#6328)
 - 28.1.98  Added FENCES_WOODEN and FENCE_GATES_WOODEN tags as fuels in AbstractFurnaceTileEntity (#6327)

            causes a huge glfwInit slowdown. Log a message too when this is detected.
            See https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1284, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10967795/directinput8-enumdevices-sometimes-painfully-slow,
            https://discourse.libsdl.org/t/win-10-initing-joystick-causes-45s-hang-in-sdl-dinput-joystickdetect/23293
 - 28.1.92  Add hooks to make it easier to add custom TNT blocks (#6290)

            on. Also, improve the custom directorymodlocator with actual custom names,
            finally, allow up to 99 log rollovers, up from 7 default (this means a
            repeatedly crashing server is less likely to roll out the log of the first
            crash).
 - 28.1.79  Fix BlockStateProvider#horizontalBlock emitting rotations >=360
 - 28.1.78  Added some more biome types to BiomeDictionary (#6250)
 - 28.1.77  Replaced getTypes invocation in ensureHasTypes with a direct reference to types, preventing infinite recursion (#6284)
            The direct reference is checked via ternary and reports if the set is empty, this is likely to result in log spam if modders don't assign types to their biomes

 - 28.1.61  Expose the registrationchange event to simple channel (not that anyone should care, but who knows?)
            Also, Context.getNetworkManager should have been public. Derp.
 - 28.1.60  Fix clientside chunk load event spam. Was an offset patch.. Also fire unload on the client side too.
 - 28.1.59  Add in an event to expose the standard MC channel stuff to network
            event channels that care about such things. Mods using simplechannel
            don't need to care.
            Also, put a sync wrapper around crashreportextender, so it doesn't
            die sometimes randomly during startup.
 - 28.1.58  Fix #6244 RightClickBlock#getUseBlock and #getUseItem being ignored (#6246)
 - 28.1.57  Fix vanilla models with parents not loading properly from forge blockstates.
 - 28.1.56  Include a profile icon for the launcher json (#6222)
 - 28.1.55  Fixed loading error/warning screen not showing (#6218)

 - 28.1.42  Better sanity checks in ModelDataManager
 - 28.1.41  Make customClientFactory optional again (#6191)
 - 28.1.40  Fix forge blockstates and custom model loading (#6154)
            * Reimplement forge blockstates variant through the use of a pseudo-model that handles the model loading, retexturing, custom data, etc. on behalf of the blockstates loader. This model gets injected into the model registry with an autogenerated unique name, to not collide with other model locations.
            * Fix model loaders not being properly initialized by calling the reload method from the loader register function. In 1.12, registering a reload listener caused the listener to be called right away from the register method. This is not true anymore.
 - 28.1.39  Add a super early GUI for showing pre-game launch messages from FML. NOTE: this cannot show on MAC because MAC can't handle
            off-thread GUIs in any way shape or form, and we need the main thread to do real work.
            Fix forge fading in wrongly.
 - 28.1.38  New round of fluid system fixes: (#6175)
            - Fix race condition lazy-initializing flowing fluid block data.
            - Fix typo in ItemTextureQuadConverter that prevents certain animated textures from being used in the fluid bucket.
            - Fix calls to onContentsChanged in FluidTank.
            - Fix FluidUtil.tryEmptyContainer logic when simulating.
            - Fix EmptyFluidHandler.fill returning the wrong number.
 - 28.1.37  Combine all hidden mod resource packs into a single sortable pack
            Fix mod datapacks sorting under vanilla
 - 28.1.36  Split server and client side pack locators apart and move them to their
            respective behavioural components. This should facilitate fixing the
            server pack data pack ordering, as well as other new features of mod
            resource packs.
 - 28.1.35  Fix dimension types being incorrect when connecting to a non-Forge server. Closes #6203
 - 28.1.34  Fix the stupid derp that broke singleplayer dims. Don't send the dim packet
            to the local client - it is not needed because obviously not. Seems to have
            fixed the problem. Probably infinity new bugs by this.
 - 28.1.33  Move OnlyIn patches on DyeColor to SAS file
            Also fix broken cobblestone stairs recipe
 - 28.1.32  Expose DyeColor#colorValue, remove OnlyIn from all DyeColor methods
 - 28.1.31  Properly propagate the DimensionType information from server to client
            at client connection time. This means the client now knows about the
            dimensiontype properly and can access the ModDimension information on
            the client.
 - 28.1.30  Fix FluidTank with empty contents throwing error if drained (#6196)
 - 28.1.29  Move opening initial screen to after startup and events are enabled (#6139)
            This allows events to be fired for the initial opening of the main menu
            Also fixes MC-145102
 - 28.1.28  Changed all calls of `BlockState#getSoundType` to use the sensitive version.  (#6120)
 - 28.1.27  Patch Sweet Berry Bush to have Crop Growth Event Hook (#6094)
 - 28.1.26  Allow structure processors to process entities
 - 28.1.25  Remove forced ANSI terminal - it breaks the Eclipse terminal output.
            As a result, we can now support coloured log output again, by default.
            Regen run configs to get the change (you should do this every update, you
            know :D)
 - 28.1.24  Make patched-in StairsBlock constructor public
            Also fix supplier generic being too narrow in DeferredRegister#register
 - 28.1.23  Integrate modlauncher changes for mixin.
 - 28.1.22  Fix new flower pot ctor not being usable with deferred register
 - 28.1.21  Usability improvements to RegistryObject/DeferredRegister
 - 28.1.20  Add constructor to StairsBlock that accepts a state supplier
 - 28.1.19  Fix server jar manifest path.
 - 28.1.18  Fix sea level not being available on client, move hook to Dimension
 - 28.1.17  Add template arg to StructureProcessor#process
 - 28.1.16  Fix timezone issue with the installer.
 - 28.1.15  Bump binpatcher and jarsplitter versions to address Java differences on older JDKs.
 - 28.1.14  Allow modded dimensions to customise World#getSeaLevel
 - 28.1.13  Fix jigsaw blocks not mirroring properly
 - 28.1.12  Fix type bound on GameRegistry.findRegistry being too narrow
 - 28.1.11  Add IExtensibleEnum#init, extend FillerBlockType/PlacementBehaviour
 - 28.1.10  Tag the deprecation of DeferredWorkQueue. I think this is causing confusion
            as to scope. Its functionality will be tied to the events in future -
            so mods can request the deferred work through methods on the Mod Lifecycle
            events directly. The API will be coming soon.
 - 28.1.9   Fixed the problem where an error would cause the main thread to continue
            even though there were still parallel threads running. Also, handle exceptions
            in the AutomaticEventSubscriber rather than leaking them to the Parallel processor.
            Actually closes #6148
 - 28.1.8   Make FlowerPotBlock extensible and reusable for mods
            - Change static lookup map to an instance variable
            - Add an instance variable for the "empty pot" for the current block
            - Keep one instance of the lookup map between the empty pot and all its full versions
            - Convert everything to use delegates
 - 28.1.7   Post tag event directly from reloader thread (#6164)
 - 28.1.6   Some tweaks around the code base. A functional consumer for networking - return a bool from your consumer function, rather than setPacketHandled.
            Tweak the server modloading behaviour to try and be a bit clearer that a mod errored.
 - 28.1.5   Update furnace fuels to not recreate it's list every query, and update when tags are reloaded. Add Tag update events. (#6140)
 - 28.1.4   Maintain default behavior for Item#canPlayerBreakBlockWhileHolding() (#6128)
 - 28.1.3   Update README badges to fix wrong version. (#6141)
 - 28.1.2   Reimplemented "MouseEvent" as RawMouseEvent for 1.14.X (#6144)
 - 28.1.1   Fix patch for vanilla spawning in WorldEntitySpawner (#6130)
 - 28.1.0   Fix Entity.getPersistentData function name. Closes #6131
            Bump spec version for first 1.14.4 RB.

28.0
====
 - 28.0.106 Fix ParticleFactoryRegisterEvent not firing (#6126)
 - 28.0.105 Minor fixes to the fluids (#6150)
            * Fixed vanilla rendering of fluids to take into account the alpha bits of the color, and fix usages accordingly.
            * Fixed missing texture derp.
 - 28.0.104 Some (sadly breaking) improvements to the Fluid API (#6110)
            * Some (sadly breaking) improvements to the API, after feedback and concerns provided by users:
              - Moved calculation of the translation key to the FluidAttributes constructor, so that builders can be shared between still & flowing sub-fluids.
              - Moved biome-based coloring to a dedicated FluidAttributes.Water variant, which is not used by default.
              - Added logic to automatically gather fluid textures into the list of textures to bake.
              - Patched BucketItem and FlowingFluidBlock to avoid eager access to the fluid objects.
              - Added a ForgeFlowingFluid class, as a more user-friendly way to construct a new FlowingFluid.
 - 28.0.103 Add new DeferredRegistry helper, and change RegistryObject to update when overrides are registered.
 - 28.0.102 Delay Block loot table name generation until needed, as calling early will result in an empty name as the block is not registered yet.
 - 28.0.101 Fix slimes splitting more times then they should. Closes #6138
 - 28.0.100 Fix a couple places not calling forge getLightValue

 - 28.0.95  Fix problem with network connections timing out frequently. Turns out
            there's a race condition - and the extra work forge does causes it to
            happen much more frequently than vanilla (though I'm sure it's a vanilla
            issue). Closes #6124, #5767 and probably lots more.
 - 28.0.94  Make /locate command support modded structures
 - 28.0.93  Make STRUCTURE_FEATURE registry a slave map of the FEATURE registry
            Also convert Feature.STRUCTURES to a slave map

 - 28.0.81  Peel IModLocator into the SPI package and extract a small IModFile
            interface as well. This allows building external IModLocator
            implementations.
 - 28.0.80  Add in some client only player connectivity events. Closes #5536
 - 28.0.79  Add in MC REGISTER nonsense. Shut up #5730
            Tweak network a bit to fix initialization order stupidity. (Constants don't
            load classes!)
 - 28.0.78  move default log level for debug file to debug instead of trace, and remove millis from console and GUI. Also remove unused config xmls
 - 28.0.77  Added getters for FMLPlayMessages.SpawnEntity
 - 28.0.76  Move indexFor and biConsumer into FMLHandshakeHandler and expose them publicly, so mods can add additional
            login messages. Closes #6087

            * Fix nulls returning from non-null methods, and null-check of non-nullable values.
            * Fix missed computation of the isEmpty flag in FluidStack
            * Cleanup getAmount/isEmpty calls.
            * Remove redundant suppliers. That info is readily available from the vanilla Fluid / FluidState.
 - 28.0.72  Minor model system cleanup/documentation (#6089)
 - 28.0.71  Fix Digging particle sometimes using the wrong block pos to get additional model data (#6077)

            when passed a modid and a type (CLIENT, COMMON or SERVER) will display
            a link in the caller's chat to open that file in the OS file viewer of choice.
 - 28.0.21  Load default configs from the defaultconfig directory by default. (Can
            be overridden in the fml.toml config file if desired).
            Will load any type of config tracked file from there - client, common, server
            or custom tracked file. This means you can ship defaults for your pack
            in a defaultconfig directory. I am thinking about ways to force a specific
            config override for an existing config.
 - 28.0.20  Fix vanilla bug that hardcore death doesn't clean up properly, leaving

            Seriously, this is how to do targeted changes to specific classes.
            In this case, adding a fieldtomethod redirect for EffectInstance.potion
            to allow substitution.

            class as suggested in the issue.
            Note: most tests are commented out at the present time, pending
            rework. Tests that work, work.
 - 28.0.9   Fix datafixer exception catch: Closes #5951

 - 28.0.1   Fix javac compile issues.
 - 28.0.0   Provisional update to 1.14.4. Missing a lot of playerinteractionmanager patches because everything moved and I'm tired.
            Fix up immediate problems.
            bump to 28.

 - 26.0.55 Fix forge event bus never starting up
 - 26.0.54 Automatically add range to config comments

           as translations aren't available either.
 - 26.0.52 Add mod failure identification
 - 26.0.51 Moved some events to the Mod's event bus. You'll need to update which bus
           you're listening to for these. (The Mod event bus is the only one actively

           instead. New Lifecycle Event for requesting data harvesting. Mods will
           be constructed, the registry will fire, and then a new Data event will
           fire. Submit new data tag files to the data gatherer if you wish.
           The game will shutdown after this. No other mod elements will happen.

 - 25.0.76  Add way to publish the reobf Jar with the maven-publish
            task. The standard way does not publish reobfuscated
            artifacts.
 - 25.0.75  Add in the ability to load modlists from a file.
            This is simple: <modfile>.list is a newline separated list
            of maven-like coordinates for mods to load into the game.
            They are searched for in all known maven roots.
 - 25.0.74  Fix rails not being able to be placed on hoppers.
 - 25.0.73  DimensionManager.registerDimension now returns the DimensionType instance for convienance.
            You can still access others in DimensionType.getByName()
            Fixed ForgeRegistry rappers not forwarding isEmpty.
 - 25.0.72  Refactor Userdev and Forgedev launching.
            Locating mods on the classpath in dev should solve linked MC sources when debugging.
            As well as loading deobfed mods.
            Rewrote how arguments are handled in dev, so users can overwrite any defaults we provide.
            Added basic Yggdrasil auth support. Passing in --username and --password arguments.
            ONLY USE IF NECESSARY. Forge is NOT responsible for your login information.
 - 25.0.71  Make userdev parse out the classifier for the Forge jar that is on the classpath.
            Should fix debugging Minecraft at dev time.
 - 25.0.70  Tidy up network initialization, and force it to classload early in
            modloading lifecycle. Closes #5576
 - 25.0.69  Tweak log4j2 config and allow access to classdump functionality from
            modlauncher.
 - 25.0.68  Fix #5584 by copying the zipped resource to a temporary directory if
            paulscode is requesting it. This is so icky.
 - 25.0.67  Log a message as well, when we crash.
 - 25.0.66  Try writing a temporary file to disk when a paulscode thread requests
            a resource, because even zipfilesystems return interruptible file channels.
 - 25.0.65  Enforce specversion number for forgeSPI so we don't crash with weird errors later.
 - 25.0.64  Put both LogicalSides on NetworkDirection:
            Origination (where it came from) and Reception (where it arrived at).
 - 25.0.63  Rewrite the FML Handshake packet formats to include actually syncing the registry data and introduce the concept of caching it locally.
            Snapshots are not injected yet due top threading issues.
 - 25.0.62  Handle differing network versions for FML gracefully?
 - 25.0.61  Fix problem with duplicate mods caused by duplicate classes found during scan.
            File Scan results are now sets.
 - 25.0.60  Try to fix #5573 by peeling the worldclient fetch into a separate handler.
 - 25.0.59  Tidy up server launch. The JAR will resolve it's libraries from a relative
            path. We just need to verify what we need is on the classpath, and
            try and handle when it's not, cleanly (by recommending running the
            installer).
            The manifest now embeds the correct launch arguments to allow FML to
            resolve - these were _never_ editable, and belong somewhere out of
            the way.

 - 25.0.52  Patch DimensionSavedDataManager to not spam FS mkdirs requests for
            empty files that don't exist yet, and don't contain data. Should
            result in a significant performance improvement for those with slower disks.

 - 24.0.98  Add back several missing patches for FML events (#5390)
 - 24.0.97  Fix dependents not being loaded into mod sorter
 - 24.0.96  Improves topological sort
            This can be used for mod sorting, dependencies between registries, etc.
            e.g. https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/4694#issuecomment-412520302
            New features:
            Now accepts guava graph
            Performance improvement: no longer reverse the graph; changed dfs to bfs
            Accepets a comparator for secondary order, e.g. natural order, index by map
            Now properly reports all cycles in a graph with Tarjan's strongly connected component algorithm
            Adds a test to prove the validity of the sort and cycle detection
            Modified build.gradle for test source directory and dependencies
            Mod loading changes:
            Sort mod file info instead of suppliers (we don't have suppliers instances)
            Moves cycle error reporting out of topological sort and into mod sorter
            Prevent mod file dependencies between mods that share the same file
 - 24.0.95  Expose a couple of mods.toml properties properly. Half-implemented
            override namespace - still needs to be reviewed and determined how this
            might work in detail.
 - 24.0.94  Use the reply logical side when enqueing work
            When receiving a packet, NetworkDirection.getLogicalSide details where
            the packet was the packet was sent from. Therefore, on a client it'll
            be SERVER (and vice virsa), and so the work is queued on the sever
            thread, instead of using Minecraft.
 - 24.0.93  Use minecraft's util class to open files
 - 24.0.92  Validate mod ids
 - 24.0.91  Fix classcast in autoeventsubscriber, also actually make progression
            work properly. This whole thing is a bit of a gross hack.
 - 24.0.90  Fix recipe constants being overridden by a blank map. Closes #5380
 - 24.0.89  Fix case error in AutomaticEventSubscriber
 - 24.0.88  Tell travis to skip 1.13 builds - they don't work there.
 - 24.0.87  Move Registry Events to the mod event bus.
            Add infrastructure to allow parallel or synchronous dispatch of
            mod events, and pass-through of events to the dispatch system.
 - 24.0.86  Greatly improve DeferredWorkQueue API (#5357)
 - 24.0.85  Add utilities that RuntimeEnumExtender expects to exist
 - 24.0.84  Re-introduce patch for injecting registry mappings during world loading.
            And re-introduce registry freezing to ONLY the Register events.
            Filter ObjectHolders by registry type and fire between every Register event.
 - 24.0.83  Implement ConfigValue as a wrapper around ForgeConfigSpec results (#5361)
 - 24.0.82  Fix exploded directory locator to actually scan all paths for a file.
 - 24.0.81  Update MDK for new naming scheme

            Co-authored-by: Gabriel Harris-Rouquette <github@gabizou.com>
 - 24.0.68  Fix blockstate id map calculation. (#5279)
 - 24.0.67  Move @EventBusSubscriber application to just after construction instead of pre-init.
 - 24.0.66  Make Block.Builder methods accessible. Closes #5310 (#5313)
 - 24.0.65  Fix exception mismatch for entity types (#5344)
 - 24.0.64  Fix datapack walking not working for mod datapacks. Closes #5334 (#5335)
 - 24.0.63  Add missing setSeed calls to ForgeBlockModelRenderer (#5338)
 - 24.0.62  Reimplement @ObjectHolder scanning, and expose system for others to add handlers.
            Fix forgedev and userdev run configs.
            Fix issue in log functions assuming String arguments.
 - 24.0.61  Fix reference to IForgeDimension.SleepResult being through Dimension, thus causing a Srg2Source issue.
            And improper getWorld patch.
 - 24.0.60  Update userdev and runconfigs for ForgeGradle changes.
 - 24.0.59  Fix some translation strings. Will pull a big string update from crowdin too.
 - 24.0.58  Fire registry events before preinit and after construct.
 - 24.0.57  Update to 0.4.0 of modlauncher
 - 24.0.56  Fix classloading properly. ModLoadingClassLoader doesn't work
            with the proper delegation model. Abandoned it, in favour of injecting
            locators into the Transformer classloader directly.
 - 24.0.55  Fix up some stuff with resource packs, so the guilist works properly.
 - 24.0.54  Update mdk with some tweaks for building
 - 24.0.53  Finish up classloading system. Use ModJARURL to locate resources
            and enable ModLauncher to use those instead. This allows all mods to load
            within the scope of the game classloader, removing weird conflicts and
            class discovery problems.
 - 24.0.52  client and server work standalone and in forge dev. Next up userdev.
            Moved some launchplugin code to the launcher. Moved servermain to
            the launcher.
            server currently needs cmdline arguments  --fml.forgeVersion=24.0.51-1.13-pre --fml.mcVersion=1.13 --fml.mcpVersion=2018.09.12.04.11.00 --fml.forgeGroup=net.minecraftforge.test
 - 24.0.51  fix up some discovery code, and make regular runtime _mostly_ work.
            Still WIP and doesn't quite get to main screen yet.
 - 24.0.50  Fix new launcher jar packaging.
            Run license checker over new code.
 - 24.0.49  separated fmllauncher code from main forge mod code. This enables much
            stronger classloader separation between the two sides. Forge now
            loads as a regular mod.
            Still needs a bunch of debugging, but structure looks good and game loads
            in forge dev.
 - 24.0.48  ResourceLocation Utils for doing things..
 - 24.0.47  Better documentation for IForgeWorldType, TERFast, TERAnimation
            Also rename AnimationTESR to TileEntityRendererAnimation

            Fix Capability injection.
 - 24.0.40  FastTESR -> TileEntityRendererFast

 - 24.0.37  Change getWorld function name to prevent inheritance change in Chunk
 - 24.0.36  Fix the path handling for mod jar resource packs. (#5228)
 - 24.0.35  Add raytrace logic to the GuiOverlayDebugForge, so that the debug overlay can show the currently targetted block and liquid. (#5278)
 - 24.0.34  Fix typo in patch, that was preventing the key assigned to the chat keybind from working while in a searchable tab in the creative GUI. (#5276)
 - 24.0.33  Fix classloading issues in userdev (and possibly also for things like tests within forgedev) (#5275)
 - 24.0.32  World and TileEntity patch work.
            TerrtainGen events are removed, 1.13's world gen re-write invalidates them all.
 - 24.0.31  Create a userdev-specific main, and include it as an injected file in the userdev jar. (#5231)
 - 24.0.30  More entity patch work. ISpecialArmor deleted.
 - 24.0.29  Port some patches to 1.13 (#5267)
 - 24.0.28  Fix vanilla exception mismatch: DataFixerUpper throws IllegalArgumentException but Minecraft tries to catch IllegalStateException instead, causing a hard crash instead of a soft one. (#5229)
 - 24.0.27  Use getRawSchemeSpecificPart to preserve escape characters in uri, fix #5236 (#5237)
 - 24.0.26  world.gen.feature patches, worldgen should be stable with vanilla. In all places I looked.
 - 24.0.25  More patch work, our async chunk loading doesn't appear to be viable for 1.13.
 - 24.0.24  Entity patches progress.
 - 24.0.23  Fix race condition causing the FML handshake to hang (#5222)
 - 24.0.22  Include project group in ForgeVersion and determine path to patched jar.
            While testing we install to net.minecraftforge.test. So don't hardcode it.
 - 24.0.21  Item and NBT patches, IShearable blocks are responsible for setting themselves to air, to allow for setting other states.
 - 24.0.20  Most client patches done except the render pipeline.
            Someone who has more in depth knowledge of that rendering system will need to do it.
 - 24.0.19  Add my 'patches_old' directory, so that people can see my "progress".
            Once the old folder is done, then patches are done.
            Want to know whats still to do? Look in that folder.
            Now stop asking.
 - 24.0.18  GUI Patches
 - 24.0.17  More patchwork.

 - v8.99.1664 Add new /forge gen command to generate large amounts of chunks.
              Usage: /forge gen <position> <count> [dimension] [notifications]
              Position is in Block Coords, and can be relative to the player. These will be converted to chunk coords for you.
              Count is the number of chunks to load. This is not a radius, actual total number of chunks.
              Dimension is optional, you can use this to pregen other worlds.
              Notifications is the chunk interval to inform you of the generating progress. This is optional and will be 5% or 100 whichever is higher.
              Added new config option to modify vanilla world gen to fix various cascading issues. MC-117810 MC-114332 and more.
              This WILL change block placement from vanilla world gen. So this is a opt-in value. Do not report differences in worlds with this flag enabled.

 - v8.99.1616 Lex doesn't like this.
              Revert "Fix up MC version compatibility checking to be a little less verbose."
              This reverts commit 1927fd76e20a1b3075cb841b09c2caeb57ebd242.
 - v8.99.1615 Fix up MC version compatibility checking to be a little less verbose.
              If people use properly formatted version compatibility strings, or the
              default compiled in one, this will work exactly as before, but has
              less dependence on specific formats for the mcversion string. So a mod
              declaring [1.11, 1.12] will now be 1.12.1 compatible by default, for
              example.

 - v8.99.1504 Loosen up registry locks until data freeze.
 - v8.99.1503 Fix conflicts
 - v8.99.1502 Implement override tracking and syncing.
              Overrides MUST be registered within a tracked event so we know what mod it came from.
              This will allow servers/saves to select which mod 'wins' and becomes to active entry.
              This should also mean that when connecting to a vanilla server things will revert.
 - v8.99.1501 Disable substitution test, substitutions are not managed the way they used to be.
              We do not care about substitutions, People who replace entries should make them compatible with the existing item.
 - v8.99.1500 Fixup some registry tests, dummies are now persisted across syncing.
 - v8.99.1499 More work, game loads and runs now.
              Moved Registry events to directly AFTER PreInit instead of before.
              This allows modders to register handlers for it without @EventBusSubscriber.
              It also allows you to register custom things needed before the construction of blocks or items such as Fluids.
              TODO: Move Fluids to a real registry.
              @ObjectHolder can now be used on private fields.
              Reworked FMLModIdMappingEvent to include data for all registries.
              Tile Entities are now registrable.
 - v8.99.1498 First pass of registry rewrite.
              Tests do not run yet.
              Things of note:
              Removed the idea of substitutions, just register multiple items with the same name they will override each other like a normal map.
              Decoupled Forge registries from vanilla classes. They now use bouncer classes. MODDERS SHOULD NEVER USE THESE
              Introduced more stringent registry locking. As it sits things are only allowed to be registered during the RegistryEvent.Registry phases!
              This is to force modders to split up their registrations, and pave the way for calling these functions multiple times during a single MC lifecycle.
              ObjectHolder, Missing Mappings, etc... *should* now work for all registry types, nothing should be special cased to Blocks/Items anymore.
              Added optional generic dummy factory to registries, to allow registry creators the ability to dummy more then just Blocks.
              Re-worked the ItemStack transformer and applied it to ItemBlock and ItemBlockSpecial. Allowing us to cleanup reflective hacks in Block callbacks.
              Registry onAdd callback is now only fired on the ACTIVE registry, fixing any issues of temp registries overriding active objects.

              Dunno, but it's a lot simpler and doesn't rely on a netty hack.
 - v8.99.1463 Fix the netty bug introduced by netty commit https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/29fdb160f33776c76f0b46aada48a9c9f3babcbf
              that means we don't get activated until after handlerAdded is complete.
              In effect, our handler can't handle anything until handlerAdded has
              completed.
 - v8.99.1462 Initial patch update to 1.12.
              Some things to note:
              Netty is screwy so currently can't join single player. @cpw
              Crafting has been MAJORY reworked. The current GameRegistry functions are nooped, this is IN THE WORKS.
                Just need to move the recipe list to a full class registry, and then re implement the in-code recipe registration.
                Also, it IS advised that modders move to JSON, because ideally we'll see a S->C recipe syncing system in 1.13
                which would allow servers to have custom recipes.
                OreDictionary currently 1/2 works, need to write a better algorithm for replacing ingredients.
                Please be patient
              Rendering:
                A lot of functions got a new float parameter, this is similar to partial ticks, needs more research

 - v8.99.1281 [1.11.x] Refine fluid placement utilities (#3509)
 - v8.99.1280 Properly filter out annotations that are for multiple mods in the same mod source.
              This prevents disabled mods from getting their proxies injected.
              Also prevents mods from getting their proxies injected multiple times.
              Effects the @EventBusSubscriber, @Instance, @Metadata, @SidedProxy annotations.
              If the target modid is not in the annotation data, and there are multiple mods in the source, it will attempt to find it by matching the annotations's class names.
              This is a potentially breaking change. Review your logs for "skipping" messages.

 - v8.99.1172 Fix proxy injector filtering. (#3300)
 - v8.99.1171 Bump version for new Recommended Build.
 - v8.99.1170 Introduce IContextSetter for events.
              This will set the active mod container for events using the normal EventBus.

              Modders, you should not use this as it has many performance implementations
              and if abused will slow down the event bus A LOT. ActiveModContainer is not
              thread safe.

 - v8.99.1163 Add support for generic filtering of events.
              Please DO NOT use this in performance sensitive environments where you will have tons of things added to the listener list.
              If that's the case define sub-classes as they have completely separate lists and will thus be more efficient when firing the event.

              versions. Forge produces a bunch of warnings in the console about this, which
              makes it more likely that an important message will be missed.

              Some vanilla resource packs exploit this issue in their custom models causing unintended rendering issues.

 - v8.99.1107 Allow CommandEvent to change the parameter set. Closes #1762
 - v8.99.1106 Another pass at substitutions - now capable of fixing up ItemBlock to point at the right block when a block is substituted, should also handle substituting itemblocks. There's some hackery in the way we have to change the value of ItemBlock.block, but it's not too egregious in my opinion.

 - v8.99.1070 Fix hotkey with default modifier loading wrong when modifier set to NONE
 - v8.99.1069 Fix async race condition on new chunks (closes #3020) (#3090)
              This patch fixes a race condition that sometimes caused a just generated chunk
              to be generated a second time.  In some this caused generated structures to
              appear incomplete such as in Issue #3020 when the second generated version
              effectively overwrote the original version of the chunk.
              This patch ensures when ProvideChunk calls LoadChunk synchronously we always
              attempt to load the chunk (if not cached) thus avoid the race condition without
              changing the logic for async loading for chunks already saved to disk.
              Thus this should retain the async functionality from PR #2946 while preventing
              generation issues caused by the race condition.
 - v8.99.1068 Some tweaks to ContainedDeps - it should extract to a file in versionedMods directly, even if the tag in the jar has a subpath element. It'll also skip if there is a matching filename in the main mods dir.

 - v8.99.1013 In accordance with our stated goal of relicensing Forge to LGPL v2.1, this commit enacts that change. Although it is using the 1.9.4 codebase, it is intended that this branch become public with the 1.10 changes, as such the license will take effect at that time. The three commits from persons who have failed to accept the new license, as documented in #2789, have had their commits reverted. This should complete the license transition. Commits after the commit date of this commit should be considered licensed by LGPLv2.1, as indicated in LICENSE-new.txt. All patches are now considered owned by the Forge project and Forge Development LLC in particular (note that they will not get the license boilerplate, as they are machine generated files).

 - v8.99.983  Fire ChunkWatchEvent.Watch event, closes #2767. Based on @sfPlayer1 patch suggestion. It looks like this logic has shifted relative to 1.8, so there may be differences in event behaviour now.
 - v8.99.982  Fix asynchronous chunk loading (#2946)
              Since the update to Minecraft 1.9.4 chunks were actually never loaded
              asynchronously because a sync request was always made from the
              PlayerChunkMap shortly after the chunk had been queued.
              - PlayerChunkMapEntry now only loads chunks synchronously *after* the
                chunk failed to load asynchronously.
              - Fixed some minor bugs that caused "Attempted to dequeue chunk" messages
              - Simplified ChunkProviderServer patch. loadChunk no longer generates chunks,
                so there is no need to handle that.
              - Moved loader and provider to ChunkIOProvider so there is no need for
                "hashCode abuse"

              Class renames: https://gist.github.com/LexManos/44dd211f90f498ad4015279b103dff86
              Tile Entities are now packed in the ChunkData packet.
              Forge intends to work around this to better support large moded worlds, but for the time being modders should implement the new function carefully and only send what data they need to!
              Minecraft's codebase now has annotations, these are directly from Mojang and should be adheared to!
              Added support for package-info.java's containing @Nullable information for all MC code base.

              However it is HIGHLY recomended that user update to Java 8.

 - v8.99.888  Fix wrong blockstate being passed to notifyNeighborsRespectDebug. (#2806)
 - v8.99.887  Only run block physics for TileEntities while capturing block placement. (#2805)
              Currently, all blocks placed by players that are not TE's run physics
              twice. Blocks that contain a TileEntity are not affected due to a check in
              'ForgeHooks.onPlaceItemIntoWorld'.
              In order to fix the problem, 'Chunk.setBlockState' will now verify if
              blocks are being captured before running onBlockAdded and if so, only run
              physics if the block has a tileentity. This check also prevents blocks
              such as TNT's from running its physics (explosion) when placement event is
              cancelled.
 - v8.99.886  Only run block physics for TileEntities while capturing block placement. (#2803)

              as TNT's from running its physics (explosion) when event is cancelled.

 - v8.99.469  Derp.
 - v8.99.468  Model loader improvements: adding custom data/textures to models that don't need them doesn't cause a error now, since it's common to put those in the defaults section of the blockstate json; you can get IModel associated with the variant now - using ModelLoaderRegistry.getModel; MultiLayerModel should now respect transformations applied to it, and respect part transformations.

 - v8.99.459  Fixed random offset not working properly for flatly-lit models.
 - v8.99.458  Explicitly close the file.
 - v8.99.457  Add a simple ContainedDep mechanic- mods can contain other mods or libs, and can specify them using a manifest tag: "ContainedDeps".
              This is a space separated (manifest standard) list of jar files that are to be extracted into the version specific directory.
              There's also a special system property "fml.skipContainedDeps" that will allow for runtime skipping of extraction of contained deps (a comma separated list, based on the file name).
 - v8.99.456  Added new get/setRegistryName functions to Item and Block.
              And helper functions in GameRegistry to allow for registering using those names automatically.

 - v8.99.433  Fix bucket replacement not loading the bucket model by itself if replacing buckets.
              This happens when no other mod that uses the bucket model is present.
              Also added a simple method for registering the bucket model, should give
              modders an idea on how to use the general model.

 - v8.99.422  Try and fix registry NPE when substitution is active.
 - v8.99.421  Blocks are no longer erased from the registry if the mod isn't present. This means that modded blocks can potentially retain their IDs
              even if they are temporarily not present in the game. Currently TileEntity data associated with the block is erased.
 - v8.99.420  Fix up persistent substitution. Should close #2259
 - v8.99.419  Fix the channel handler naming. It now uses the standard netty namer for it, by careful use of cunning reflection.
 - v8.99.418  Fixed vanilla bug related to spawning entities on top of fences. Closes #2303
 - v8.99.417  Fixed registry issues that prevented connecting to 1.8 Forge servers.
              More precisely: Servers with missing registries default back to frozen version.
              Throw descriptive error if we do not have any information.

 - v8.99.407  Fixed java6 errors in previous commit.
 - v8.99.406  IModel can now depend on a variant definition (ModelResourceLocation); added MultiLayerModel - simple model that'll render correctly in multiple layers + example of using it.
 - v8.99.405  Preparations for the Animation system.
              Changes to the Model API - IModelState now works with Optional. Handling of parts of the model is not optional, and coordinate space/result interpretation is up to the caller. IModel doesn't extend IModelPart by default anymore; MapModelState uses composition to achieve previous functionality, IModelPart implementations are disjoint now. Updated perspective handing to the new API, removed IPerspectiveState (MapModelState is now the same thing). Perspective transforms for the default fluid model.

 - v8.99.332  OMG! Documentation? WUT? I haz lost my mind.
              Also, Functional interface for IMC. Senders can send a classname implementing Guava's function, and receivers

 - v8.99.320  Fix derpy fir trees in the taiga. So many patches. See if we can find any more mistakes?!
 - v8.99.319  Fix weird patch issue where the this FG commit: https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle/commit/2f0ca9921b961133689d29b807333241010a802d
              breaks if the exact end of a line is a srgname. Not ideal, but should work.

 - v8.99.264  Fix firing the remap event. It always fires now, and additionally fires when the registry reverts to frozen.
              Most mods refer to the gameregistry for ids they care about, so this shouldn't affect anything significantly,
              but if your mod was dependent on their being content in the remap event, and only acting on that content,
              empty content means it's "reverted to frozen" state - the state at the start of the game.
 - v8.99.263  Fix a possible NPE when checking supertypes of interfaces. Closes #2176.

              -- Fixes #2100
              -- Iterates over badTextureDomains instead of missingTextures.keySet()
              as a domain can have broken textures without any missing textures
 - v8.99.241  Introduce a new centralized version checking system.
              Using the @Mod annotation mods can opt-in to a centrally controlled update system.
              This is PURELY a notification system and will NOT automatically download any updates.
              The End User can control which mods check for updates and disabel the system entirely using the Forge Config and GUI.
              Format for the json the URL must point to is described here: https://gist.github.com/LexManos/7aacb9aa991330523884
 - v8.99.240  Redesign the ModList GUI to use a scrolling list for the main body content.
              Allowing for larger information to be displayed.

 - v8.99.234  Obj loader: fix vertices shared between faces having the same attributed (uvs/normals).
 - v8.99.233  OBJ loader: fixed another whitespace-related issue; removed unused "modifyUVs" property for now; added the "flip-v" property to switch between OpenGL-style and DirextX-style model UVs; fixed normals - they are now correct in-world, still a bit strange for the items; fixed normals a little bit for B3D models too.
 - v8.99.232  Fix color multiplier applied incorrectly for items.
 - v8.99.231  OreDictionary will warn if there's an invalid ore being registered now, rather than just
              using -1 and doing weird things with the list as a result.
 - v8.99.230  Fix substitutions for recipes and oredict recipes. Should mean that substitutions start working properly.
 - v8.99.229  Merge pull request #2154 from shadekiller666/OBJ_Loader
              OBJLoader Update: Fix for normal generation, whitespace handling, and UVs outside 0-1 range
 - v8.99.228  Fix for the previous commit - transparent blocks were handled improperly.
 - v8.99.227  Changed how the forge lighting system handles holey models for opaque blocks; it now mimics vanilla behaviour, which allows light to pass through them.
 - v8.99.226  OBJLoader: Quick bandages to support/fix the new way that face/vertex normals are calculated, a very quick bandage to patch TextureCoordinates for the time being, and the Parser now uses a Pattern to split strings on whitespace instead of only splitting on " ".
 - v8.99.225  Merge pull request #2151 from AbrarSyed/patch-1
              Update FG version to 2.0.2

              Fixed a bug with item model loading
 - v8.99.212  Small fix for reworked classic lighting
 - v8.99.211  Fixed a bug with item model loading that would occur if ModelBakery.addVariantName() was called with the same string location parameter for 2 different items, and the string pointed to a location that didn't exist, where ModelLoader.loadAnyModel() would substitute the blockdefinition in for the item model, but wouldn't remove the original input location from the loadingModels list, which would cause the location from the second call to throw an IllegalStateException even though that location now has a model.
 - v8.99.210  Added OBJ loader for the ModelLoaderRegistry system.
 - v8.99.209  Added back in the lost class
 - v8.99.208  Model pipeline system.
              Should replace all ad-hoc quad generation methods in forge, and make IBakedModel -> WorldRenderer data transfer faster. Added IVertexConsumer + helper classes; lighting that works correctly for non-axis-aligned faces using the new infrastructure. Changed smooth lighting algorithm, now it should work correctly for everything.
              New block lighter can be disabled in the forge config options.

 - v8.99.202  Fix CME when entities are spawned from EntityJoinWorldEvent
 - v8.99.201  '#' is now added automatically to the beginning of the texture names in B3D models, and the remapping is expected via the blockstate JSON, since it's more reasonable than adding it to the file name in the modelling program or matching the resource location with the filename.
 - v8.99.200  Fixes Attributes.transform affecting only 1 vertex.
 - v8.99.199  Merge pull request #2103 from olee/patch-1

              There is currently no way to check if an event handler has been registered or not.
              But when trying to unregister a not-registered event handler, Minecraft crashes with a NullPointerException.
              This is a simple fix to prevent such crashes.
 - v8.99.179  More cleanup of the default eclipse workspace. The project is now called "MDKExample" not "Minecraft".
              The project tree is now contemporary, instead of a copy from 1.5.x era MC. The launches are cleaned up, and refer to
              a better default "runDir" of "run" rather than "eclipse".. Updating to FG2.0.1 which will contain relevant binary fixes.
 - v8.99.178  Fix eclipse workspace inside the mdk - don't run it through the tokenconverter. Also add in CREDITS-fml.txt to the MDK - it's still required.
 - v8.99.177  Fixed issue where config folder would not be created before SplashProgress tried to read from it.
              Default macs to disable the new loading screen due to to many macs having issues.

              the MDK- it fails to run setupDecompWorkspace.
              Filed an issue at ForgeGradle, since this seems to be something FG2 shouldn't
              be doing, but is?
              https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle/issues/235

              run down the curtain and joined the bleedin' choir invisible!! THIS IS AN EX-PROJECT!
 - v8.99.160  Vestigal fml-ectomy.
 - v8.99.159  FML is no more. FML has ceased to be. FML's expired and gone to meet its maker. FML's a stiff! Bereft of life, FML rests in peace.

 - v8.99.104  Mods that are extracted to the mods dir by unzipping or whatever will now cause the game to crash. Too much info is in the META-INF now,

 - v8.99.5    Clean up transformers a bit. Can't use COMPUTE_FRAMES even though it's required - the game refuses to even
              run if I do. Note for j8: when we force Java8 classes, all coremods will need a thorough overhaul - the

              on every call to processWindowMessages, we will simply skip it, if the mutex is already
              claimed by the display thread. This should fix slow loading issues seen by some with
              the new loading screen.
 - v8.99.0    Fix patches after last fml merge.

 - v99.99-pre-4210 Fluids are now tracked internally by mod. This allows for the server and the world to specify a "default"
                   in the case of a possible alternative fluid implementation. If you always called registerFluid, things
                   should work pretty seamlessly, but if you didn't (gating with an isFluidRegistered check for example)
                   you should change to register anyway. This way, even if you're not default in the overall instance, you may
                   become default if you're the only mod present on a server, for example, or in a world save.
                   This should radically decrease the mixups caused by mod load ordering problems, and other issues around fluid
                   tracking.

                   [1.7.10] Fix FluidRegsitry.registerFluid
 - v99.99-pre-4188 Fix FluidRegsitry.registerFluid
                   FluidRegistry:
                   ```java
                       static BiMap<String, Fluid> fluids = HashBiMap.create();
                       static BiMap<Fluid, Integer> fluidIDs = HashBiMap.create();
                   ...
                       public static boolean registerFluid(Fluid fluid)
                       {
                           if (fluidIDs.containsKey(fluid.getName()))
                               ^^^^^^^
                   ```
                   There is definitely should be fluids instead fluidIDs. This mistake broke many mods.

                   If the dat file isn't in the dimension specific folder but is present in the vanilla data folder then copy it over.
 - v99.99-pre-4181 You shouldn't be creating FluidStacks from unregistered Fluids. Warn clearly on failed registrations, and make a useful log message for failed fluidstack
                   creations. Should help a lot with tracking down broken mods that are doing this wrongly.
 - v99.99-pre-4180 Allow for duplicate Fluid Blocks. It's annoying to be sure but just as with the OreDictionary, we'll have to handle it.
 - v99.99-pre-4179 Fix formatting
 - v99.99-pre-4178 Add in a fluidid transformer
 - v99.99-pre-4177 Removed fluidID from ItemStack.
                   This fixes a rather huge issue where FluidStacks on the client could be desynced if a modder was unaware of it.
                   This is a breaking change but can be mitigated with a transformer to the getter getFluidID().

                   RenderPlayerEvent.Specials was removed because the special effects are done in the LayerRenderer now.
 - v99.99-pre-4172 Forge really should have always supported the concept of an "exact spawn". Individual world providers can still
                   change this behaviour of course, but for default maps it makes sense to support it as a config option.

                   Add method to set entity placement type.
 - v99.99-pre-4106 Current spawner implementation checks the EntitySpawnPlacementRegistry hashmap to check where a entity should spawn
                   as there is no way to modify this without the use of reflection or a AT, you can not specify where you want your entity to spawn
                   adding this helper method will allow developers to specify where they want their entity to spawn.

 - v99.99-pre-4058 Added ability for language files to opt-in to loading using normal Java properties format.
                   This allows for escape characters, as well as keeping %d and %f replacements in tact.
                   To opt-in, the lang file must have this comment line:
                   # PARSE_ESCAPES
                   As this is opt-in, any errors resulting from misused format strings is on the modder/end user.

                   In the previous code the destination block was still Air and would would
                   cause a crash because air doesn't have a property for LEVEL
 - v99.99-pre-4037 Merge pull request #1521 from RainWarrior/model-system
                   Model loader registry
 - v99.99-pre-4036 Added model loader registry
                   Entry point: ModelLoaderRegistry
                   loader interface: ICustomModelLoader
                   custom model: IModel
                   ModelLoader is responsible for splicing into vanilla model system.
                   (you probably don't need to use it directly)
                   Interop with vanilla models isn't great yet
                   (vanilla models can't refer to custom ones as parents), will improve in
                   the future.
                   Includes loader for B3D models, with animation support
                   (net.minecraftforge.client.model.b3d).
                   Blender export plugin with compatible coordinate system:
                   https://github.com/RainWarrior/B3DExport
                   OBJ loader is being written, will be included at some point in the
                   future. For now you can convert OBJ to B3D via blender, or wait.
 - v99.99-pre-4035 Update to ASM5 for Java 8 support
                   SpecialSource updated ASM5 and ForgeGradle supports ASM5 as well but
                   neither FML or Forge were actually updated to support ASM5 opcodes. This
                   commit resolves this.

                   Right now the complete com.mojang package is excluded from the LaunchClassLoader on the server. This means mods can't transform authlib for example which doesn't need to be excluded for the UI to work. By excluding only the specific log4j2 QueueLogAppender, mods can also transform the classes in the com.mojang.authlib package.

                   Some notes:
                   Almost all int x, int y, int z parameters have been changed to BlockPos class
                   ForgeDirection has been removed, replaced by net.minecraft.util.EnumFacing.
                   All FML classes have moved from packet cpw.mods.fml to net.minecraftforge.fml
                   Fluid Rendering has been disabled for the time being, to be re-evaulated and a test mod created for it.
                   Minecraft now uses a Model based system for rendering blocks and Items. The intention is to expand the model format to better suit modder's needed once it is evaulated.
                   As such, The model loaders from Forge have been removed, to be replaced by expanding vanilla's model format.
                   Metadata has been extracted out in Minecraft to IBlockState, which holds a list of properties instead of magic number metadata. DO NOT listen to the fearmongering, you can do EVERYTHING with block states you could previously with metadata.
                   Stencil Bits are disabled entirely by for the main Display, Modders must enable and recreate the FrameBuffer if they wish to use Stencil Bits.

 - v99.99-pre-3909 Fixes client-side fake rain
                   Changes the updateWeather function in WorldServer to only send the
                   weather info to players in the correct dimension, rather than all
                   players on the server. This is what causes the client-side rain, as the
                   client believes that it has started raining locally, rather than in
                   another dimension.

                   Added mappings to default build.gradle
 - v99.99-pre-3869 added mappings to default build.gradle
 - v99.99-pre-3868 Merge pull request #1367 from bloodmc/blockplace
                   Added PlaceEvent and MultiPlaceEvent which fires before placing a block.
 - v99.99-pre-3867 Added PlaceEvent and MultiPlaceEvent which fires before placing a block.
                   Before calling "ItemStack.tryPlaceItemInWorld", a recording flag is turned on for
                   setBlock to capture a blocksnapshot for each block that attempts to be placed.
                   If 1 block is captured, a "BlockEvent.PlaceEvent" is fired to notify mods.
                   If 2 or more blocks are captured, a "BlockEvent.PlaceEvent" is fired first with the first block
                   captured followed by a "BlockEvent.MultiPlaceEvent" with all captured blocks. This extra event
                   is required for items that have the ability to place 2 or more blocks such as a BlockBed.
                   If either event is cancelled, the recorded block snapshot(s), item stacksize, and item meta will
                   revert back to the captured snapshot(s).
                   If the events are not cancelled, a notification will be sent to clients and block physics will be updated.
                   What this means for mods is Forge will be able to capture all player block placement automatically and fire
                   a PlaceEvent and/or MultiPlaceEvent.
                   If for whatever reason your mod does not use the standard placement methods then you will need to fire the
                   appropriate placement events in order to notify mods/servers.
                   This commit also includes a new utility class called BlockSnapshot which is serializable. This new class is used in conjunction with
                   both PlaceEvent and MultiPlaceEvent in order to record a snapshot of block space before it is altered. This
                   allows us to restore the block(s) if an event is cancelled. The class also provides the ability to restore a snapshot
                   to any location using the restoreToLocation method. This should be helpful to many mods that are looking to be able
                   to capture block data then restore it to back to any location required.

                   Blender names objects with .001 ir .002 when separating vertices or duplicating objects and the importer would crash on them. This fixes the regex to allow dots in the name.
 - v99.99-pre-3841 MinecraftForge/FML@dc02d56195606d3ba2f1c5036fc8c0ddb67c843f Fix derp with ModType annotation. mods should load again now..
 - v99.99-pre-3840 Fix derp with ModType annotation. mods should load again now..
 - v99.99-pre-3839 MinecraftForge/FML@4ce3e73bfe36c02b10f504f93eff1bc94d640e32 Add overloaded version of SimpleNetworkWrapper#registerMessage that takes the MessageHandler instance directly, allowing to specify the same handler for multiple messages.
                   MinecraftForge/FML@cbe2ccbda461ec0ecf4d776fcd19ab31930cc3f1 Add in ModType to the jar manifest. If it's present, and doesn't have value "FML" it will be skipped from the modloading cycle. This should let liteloader mods have a .jar extension.
                   MinecraftForge/FML@37cf0174fc62a842d132b2c2cc31e477acfba205 OK, lets make that a csv list. It'll let you be liteloader and fml in one jar file!
                   MinecraftForge/FML@0475b15eb1a7c35bf4959f1af40606e6ee8a9d03 Change the mods and modListFile argument handling a bit. Other tweakers will get a chance at looking at them now - they're only removed right before launch.
                   MinecraftForge/FML@abeac06a2e9bf8825b058fa35291165b4d1f1fb3 Two new features. ModLists can have a "parent" mod list. Circularity will result in a crash, so be careful. Mods specified in a child will override ones from a parent (using the maven group:name:classifier triple to identify - ignoring the version component)
                   MinecraftForge/FML@7fcfedcfef9b5fd85cd1c17aa2013fca1bacd871 Canonicalized file paths in modListFile handling with the minecraftDirectory.
                   MinecraftForge/FML@633fce19d4b367aed56d79e916f17296842f675c Make Keyevent also fire for key releases
                   MinecraftForge/FML@57ba2339b630afa22c0fdf060bf28edbf7b34d0f Merge branch 'keyup-event' of github.com:diesieben07/FML

                   ones from a parent (using the maven group:name:classifier triple to identify -
                   ignoring the version component)
                   Finally, ModSide is now doable in MANIFEST.MF. If you have this, it can tell
                   a mod to only load on a client, or on a dedicated server (though I'd watch out
                   before using the dediserver one, you'll never load in integrated servers then).
                   The default value is BOTH, which means you'll load both sides, other values are
                   CLIENT and SERVER, obviously. Perhaps, also, CAULDRON might be possible?
 - v99.99-pre-3833 Change the mods and modListFile argument handling a bit. Other tweakers will get a chance at looking
                   at them now - they're only removed right before launch.
 - v99.99-pre-3832 OK, lets make that a csv list. It'll let you be liteloader and fml in one jar file!
 - v99.99-pre-3831 Add in ModType to the jar manifest. If it's present, and doesn't have value "FML"
                   it will be skipped from the modloading cycle. This should let liteloader mods have a .jar extension.
 - v99.99-pre-3830 GIANT FML UPDATE! Bump forge revision number, and fix patches for ItemStack changes. More to come on this branch I expect.
                   MinecraftForge/FML@7c5cf219042581545b6073de4e947448ffa10879 Implement STDOUT/STDERR redirection.
                   MinecraftForge/FML@bc78e31cb7ad4eda6e5faa173cd6b21e70a2c444 added support for \n in tooltip strings added \n test tooltip localization fixed int/double conversion error in slider entry added test slider scenario that highlighted conversion error

                   MinecraftForge/FML@e77da9eb2f5c58a494ed100dd4c1dd1a0c341dbf And fix the read side too, incase someone is trying to bitbang and failing.
                   MinecraftForge/FML@305d8950c9332c7a7f290db05e6f18ef328016e2 Make LogContext optional. This can be useful for debugging mod issues, but Apache's implementation in log4j2 is responsible for a very significant % of the overall runtime. Quite frankly this is shockingly bad performance from what is supposed to be a high performance logging framework. Anyway, until we can figure out if we can fix it, we're turning it off by default.
                   MinecraftForge/FML@bdfca1c8ed463a6053526c7a46a990007711e3d0 Make more noise when people screw up mod downloading and put .jar.zip in their mod folders.

                   might see two TEs for a single setblock where previously you saw one. This is a phantom TE being created by badly written neighbour triggers - I'm looking at you
                   redstone.
                   Anyway, with luck, this'll close a slew of bugs across Forge, IC2, MFR, TE, RC. Yeah, fun times. Thanks to LexManos, skyboy and KingLemming for helping figure this
                   issue out. Quite frankly, from now on, issues with phantom TEs will be mods behaving badly. Modders will need to adapt.

 - v99.99-pre-3762 - Added drainFluidContainer() and getContainerCapacity() helper methods.
 - v99.99-pre-3761 Make LogContext optional. This can be useful for debugging mod issues, but
                   Apache's implementation in log4j2 is responsible for a very significant % of
                   the overall runtime. Quite frankly this is shockingly bad performance from
                   what is supposed to be a high performance logging framework. Anyway, until we
                   can figure out if we can fix it, we're turning it off by default.
 - v99.99-pre-3760 And fix the read side too, incase someone is trying to bitbang and failing.

                   don't discard it silently. Should stop pixelmon blaming forge for their mistakes.

 - v99.99-pre-3613 Pop version for new Recomended build.
 - v99.99-pre-3612 Load chunks asynchronously for players.
                   When a player triggers a chunk load via walking around or teleporting
                   there is no need to stop everything and get this chunk on the main thread.
                   The client is used to having to wait some time for this chunk and the
                   server doesn't immediately do anything with it except send it to the
                   player. At the same time chunk loading is the last major source of file IO
                   that still runs on the main thread.
                   These two facts make it possible to offload chunks loaded for this reason
                   to another thread. However, not all parts of chunk loading can happen off
                   the main thread. For this we use the new AsynchronousExecutor system to
                   split chunk loading in to three pieces. The first is loading data from
                   disk, decompressing it, and parsing it in to an NBT structure.  The second
                   piece is creating entities and tile entities in the chunk and adding them
                   to the world, this is still done on the main thread. The third piece is
                   informing everyone who requested a chunk load that the load is finished.
                   For this we register callbacks and then run them on the main thread once
                   the previous two stages are finished.
                   There are still cases where a chunk is needed immediately and these will
                   still trigger chunk loading entirely on the main thread. The most obvious
                   case is plugins using the API to request a chunk load. We also must load
                   the chunk immediately when something in the world tries to access it. In
                   these cases we ignore any possibly pending or in progress chunk loading
                   that is happening asynchronously as we will have the chunk loaded by the
                   time they are finished.
                   The hope is that overall this system will result in less CPU time and
                   pauses due to blocking file IO on the main thread thus giving more
                   consistent performance. Testing so far has shown that this also speeds up
                   chunk loading client side although some of this is likely to be because
                   we are sending less chunks at once for the client to process.
                   Thanks for ammaraskar for help with the implementation of this feature.

This frozen map is used to inject "new" stuff into existing serverside worlds. Interesting sideeffect: remote servers lacking things will change the client, to also LACK ids for those things. watch for -1 ids in your remap events. Note: idmaps should be considered temporary per server instance. SERVERSTOPPED will restore "startup" state, as will client logout.

It allows an itemstack's tooltip to be changed depending on the player, itemstack or whether the advanced information on item tooltips is being shown, toggled by F3+H.

                   Also done for my sanity while reading through the code.
                   Intruduced a new function. If there is a 'mcp_data' folder in the FML folder, it will be copied to the MCP work directory after MCP is extracted.
                   It DOES overwrite anything that already exists.
                   This is intended for places like BuildServer to place libraries/assets to prevent them from needing to be downloaded every version.
                   Introduced a dev-env json. Need to write the eclipse workspace references to the new libraries.

                   New parameter:
                     --no-assets: Disables the downloading of minecraft's asset tree, recomended that build servers supply this flag to prevent downloading of useless data.
 - v99.99-pre-2532 Add an InputStream constructor to WavefrontObject
                   It is said that Resource Packs will return InputStreams. And I like putting my models into texture packs which, obviously, give InputStreams rather than URLs.

 - v99.99-pre-2477 Add support for servers to register dimensions on client.
                   In order to support multi-worlds such as MultiVerse, the server needs the
                   ability to register dimensions on client or many forge mods such as IC2
                   will not function correctly. This has been an issue for MCPC which
                   provides both Forge and Bukkit support to players. By adding the
                   DimensionRegisterPacket class, MCPC now has the ability to send the
                   required packet to client to register a dimension with DimensionManager.

 - v99.99-pre-2309 Pulled Biome Tag System by Emasher, Closes #433
                   An issue with biome adding mods which is becoming increasingly annoying for players, is that many mod authors that add biome specific world generation or mobs in their mods, for the most part, hard code them to work with vanilla biomes only. This becomes a huge problem when it's difficult to even find a vanilla biome, let alone a specific one, when biome mods are installed.
                   A simple solution to this problem is a tag system for biomes that allows mod authors to set up their world generators, or mobs to generate or spawn in biomes that have been registered with a specific tag such as "FOREST", or "FROZEN". I wrote such a system a few months ago, which I've been using with my own mods, and have made available to anyone who wants to use it. Since then, I've had requests from mod authors and players alike to try and get it, or at least similar functionality, into Forge, where other mod authors will be more comfortable using it.
                   Aside from the tags, it also includes a rule based system to classify biomes that have not already been registered with it when information is requested on them (You can opt out of this by registering a biome as type "NULL"). And additionally, the ability to register IWorldGenerators for specific biomes, or biome types (tags) to speed up chunk generation a little bit.

 - v99.99-pre-2307 Add checking for 'ENUM$VALUES' in EnumHelper. Eclipse uses it's own internal compiler which does not follow the java standard of making the values field names $VALUES and private. Instead its public and ENUM$VALUES. Closes #502

                   ingredients.

                   place during the ReadNBT call.

                   IExtendedEntityProperties classes, as well as saving and loading to NBT.

                   System.out.println("\n") causes currentMessage to start with a newline character, which means idx will always be 0 from then on. Therefore if idx is 0 messages must still be logged, otherwise no more messages sent to stdout will be logged and they will just accumulate in currentMessage.

                   and IMCEvent will no longer remove messages if no one gets them, so you can do

                   You should be able to filter a lot of messages based on things like modid and certain FML related features that can be noisy

 - v99.99-pre-1993 Final part of the deobfuscation data setup- fields are now deobfuscated as well.
                   All that remains, is to figure out what and how to distribute the deobfuscation data itself.
 - v99.99-pre-1992 Read the joined.srg file directly from lib/deobfuscation_data.zip now. Still debating distribution method.
 - v99.99-pre-1991 Now actually works for mods, somewhat. It currently generates access violations for
                   ModLoader mods that presume access to fields that are not actually accessible from
                   a different package.

                   help mod developers- if you see this when testing your mod with, say, mystcraft, you're probably
                   keeping a hold of an invalid handle to the World (either directly, or indirectly via Entity or TileEntity)
                   and you should look to refactor to wrap those handles in WeakReferences
 - v99.99-pre-1985 Add in a mechanism for explicit subclassing of WeightedRandomChestItem to allow for

 - v99.99-pre-1901 Fix multiple GUI containers for ML containers. Sorry ultimatechest that
                   this fix took so long, a bug report at github.com/cpw/FML would help,
                   next time ;)

 - v99.99-pre-1890 Protect deflation with a simple semaphore. Should close #336
 - v99.99-pre-1889 Update FML: Fix NPE in fingerprint loading, and pass expectged fingerprint to FMLFingerprintViolationEvent
 - v99.99-pre-1888 Fix NPE in fingerprint loading, and pass expectged fingerprint to FMLFingerprintViolationEvent
 - v99.99-pre-1887 Force parent ListenerListInsts to rebuild.
                   Without this change, it is possible (and, in fact, nearly guaranteed) for lists to rebuild endlessly if a parent list is marked as needing a rebuild but never actually read. This change forces the parent list(s) to rebuild as well, resulting in a significant performance increase and smoother framerate due to greatly reduced GC activity.
 - v99.99-pre-1886 Update FML: 7e6456d
                   7e6456d Fix a message delivery issue in IMC

                   https://mojang.atlassian.net/browse/MC-1594
                   Issue #318, let me know if you notice any issue.
 - v99.99-pre-1883 Fixed parameter ordering u.u
 - v99.99-pre-1882 Re-write/Deprecated DungeonHooks loot tables, now uses ChestGenHooks like the rest of the world gen. Also fixes issue #330 by adding in enchanted books.
                   Should be API compatible.
 - v99.99-pre-1881 Move chunk compression to the network thread in Packet 51 and 56
                   This will reduce the server load considerably by doing the chunk data compression in writePacketData, which will be run from the network thread.
                   The chunk compression can easily use 1/4th of the overall server thread CPU time if someone is exploring much, especially when moving quickly (e.g. with quantum leggings).
                   Player, this is how it's properly done.

                   that previously exists under a new name: canApplyAtEnchantingTable()
                   to determine enchantments that can apply at the enchanting table (a smaller
                   subset of all possible enchantments for an item, now). Also, add your
                   enchantments to the anvil book application list, if neccessary.
 - v99.99-pre-1873 Tweak packet56 to see if this resolves the apparent worldgen derpiness
 - v99.99-pre-1872 Server side only item callback: allow a held item to decide if it wants to pass sneak-clicks through
                   to a block, or not. Defaults false- the same as the new vanilla behaviour (sneak clicks with an item
                   in hand don't activateBlock anymore).

 - v99.99-pre-1862 Access Transform a couple of methods

 - v99.99-pre-1711 Fix #289
 - v99.99-pre-1710 Add in some additional ticket loading callbacks for ChickenBones. Closes #284
                   Add in a call to determine if there are possible chunktickets for a world. This should let
                   Mystcraft and other dynamic world generating mods check if they should immediately load
                   a world based on existing chunk tickets.

                   Added new getTerrainBlock whihc will limit the resuling ID to < 256, useful for world gen.
                   Calls to getBlock with IDs less then 256 will be assigned values above 256 {Thus freeing up terrain gen slots}
                   Made ConfigCategory implement Map<String, Propertery> should fix compatibility with most mods that broke two builds ago.

 - v99.99-pre-1692 Merge pull request #274 from iChun/patch-2
                   Add check that Entity saves to disk before saving entity to saved chunkloading data.
 - v99.99-pre-1691 Add check that Entity saves to disk before saving entity to saved chunkloading data.
                   Returning false to addEntityID prevents the entity from being saved (cred to LexManos)
                   Entities which do not save to disk but are chunkloaders causes errors the next time the world loads. This ought to fix it.
 - v99.99-pre-1690 Updated FML, proper free-sprite list for /gui/items.png, and fixed MCP version.

                   The ordering before would skip about in the ids and metadata arrays.  This runs linearly and should improve performance.
                   Done live on github
 - v99.99-pre-1687 Fixes some weird formatting
 - v99.99-pre-1686 Adds a more intelligent chunk constructor

                   sensitive, has intelligent coord ordering, and which allows for
                   generation at greater heights than 127.

                   Note that if the mod does derp, it's data is lost. It's not FML or Minecraft Forge's
                   responsibility if "DirtChest 2000 Mk5" can't write their TileEntity method correctly
                   and you lose your 100000 diamonds.

 - v99.99-pre-1431 MapStorage Fix
                   Fixes setting and timing of map storage object to allow for the

                   Moves setting of spawn to after provider setup
 - v99.99-pre-1430 Adds world unloading and hotloading calls
                   Adds world unloaded message to MinecraftServer on save.
                   Adds world unloading calls to chunk provider/manager when all chunks are
                   unloaded.
                   Adds call in MinecraftServer getWorld to hotload world if it isn't
                   loaded.
 - v99.99-pre-1429 Improves DimensionManager
                   Adds handling for unloading and hotloading of worlds, fixes some typos,
                   allows for dimensions to be unregistered (allowing save specific
                   dimension registrations), general changes to match these features.

 - v99.99-pre-1415 Fix buckets, need to rethink for bukkit compatibility.
 - v99.99-pre-1414 A few requested features of ForgeChunkManager. Mods can specify a
                   chunkloading config directly in the config file, including chunk
                   loading overrides if they wish (and the config allows them).
                   Also added "player" tied tickets that bind to the player and not the
                   mod's quota.

 - v99.99-pre-1401 Extreme headless mode is back!
 - v99.99-pre-1400 Some more tweaks to the chunkloading code. The world.load event fires slightly later- once the entity watcher is
                   set up, so entities can actually load into the server world. Also, tickets actually save and load properly
                   and null entities don't break the server

 - v99.99-pre-1392 Changed Configuration to use overloaded methods, and changed the order of arguments to be Category, Key, Value instead of Key, Category, Value to hopefully help cleanup some peopels code.
                   Added function to get a free Item id. Will only accept values that are not in the block space. Needs testing.
                   Marked all the old getOrCreate* functions as deprecated.

 - v99.99-pre-1388 Fix some errors if the config is unparseable. It should log an exception and carry on with defaults.
 - v99.99-pre-1387 More modifications to the ticket callback handling system. There are up to two callbacks during world loading now. One to allow
                   selective preference for ticket types. The other to actually allow the mod to force chunks.
 - v99.99-pre-1386 Some changes to the ForgeChunkManager.
                   Null modData is allowed now.
                   The entity id is actually properly persisted in the ticket now.
                   There is a new "orderedLoadingCallback" that allows you to provide a preferred ticket loading order in case of "excess tickets". Also, tickets
                   that are not in the returned list are now unregistered.
                   There is a way to resort the chunks in the forced chunklist on a ticket now.

 - v99.99-pre-1253 Some functionality fixes for @Instance injection.
 - v99.99-pre-1252 Versions now have two flavours: the @Mod(version) which is the "programmatic version" and
                   is used for all version relationship calculation. The "display version" as sourced from
                   mcmod.info is used for display purposes only and can be literally anything. Note: they fall back
                   to one another when they're missing, and to "1.0" if both are absent.
                   Also, changed @Instance. Now, you can inject *other* mods using @Instance as long as you depend
                   on them as a "before" or "dependency" relationship. Classes containing @Instance will only be
                   loaded if the Mod the @Instance refers is present. So you don't have to worry about runtime class
                   resolution.

                   Initial commit, needs some more testing and design thoughts.

                   NetworkMods will be assigned unique ModIDs by the server, and those IDs will be sent to the client upon connection.
                   Refactored Forge packets to the net.minecraft.src.forge.packets package. And introduced the base ForgePacket class.

                   Also, install scripts now prompt for input to cleanup.

 - v99.99-pre-224  Update MCP Mapings
 - v99.99-pre-223  Refactored so that ISpecialArmor items do not see the factor of 25 on the damage.
                   The value returned form ISpecialArmor.getProperties is now copied, so mod items are free to re-use there return values.
 - v99.99-pre-222  Reworked ISpecialArmor to provide better functionality as requested by IC2 devs.
                   Armor can now be prioritized over other armor.
                   It can deal with damaging it's own itemstacks.
                   Also impkemented the ISpecialArmor.getArmorDisplay

                   http://www.mod-buildcraft.com/forums/topic/hook-intercept-item-pickups-by-player-entities/?view=all
 - v99.99-pre-214  Merged in the change to ISpecialArmor to introduce the DamageSource argument.
                   As well as the concept of damage absorption vs reduction.
 - v99.99-pre-213  Created a Entity tracking ans spawning system.
                   Mod creators should call MinecraftForge.registerEntity to register a entity.
                   All entity ID numbers are Mod Unique. Meaning two mods can have Entity #1.
                   Added client and server side packet handlers for the 'Forge' channel. For use in internal packets such as the new Spawn packet.
                   Updated the build scripts to copy over unique server source files now that there actually are some.
                   For modders:
                     If you have a entity that used MLMP's 'owner' system, you should have your entity implement IThrowableEntity
                     If you have a entity that implments MLMLP's ISpawnable, you should implement ISpawnHandler.
                   They provide the same functionality, just in a cleaner, more orginized way and will be the method used when we eventually drop MLMP.
 - v99.99-pre-212  Fixed return value for un/registerChannel. Now returns properly indicate when un/register commands should be sent.
 - v99.99-pre-211  Setup .gitignore for eclipse bin dirs.
                   Fixed line endings in install.sh

                   Cleaned up some extra echos in scripts.

                   Also added a NBTTagCompound to the base EntityClass, this allows any entity to be given arbitrary data that will persist across world saves.
                   This data is NOT sent over the wire in a MP situation, to have data sent over the wire automatically use the built in data watcher.

                   -Will now move fernflower.jar if it is found, so that MCP will not decompile using it.
                       Should fix the issues of people trying to use forge with fernflower installed.
